/**
    @notice Interface of the ERC4626 "Tokenized Vault Standard", modified to emit ERC-1155 receipts.
    When depositing a receipt is generated using an id provided by implementor of this interface.
    The receipt should contain the deposit amount. The id can be used freely to identify extra information
    about the deposit.
    
    @dev The `withdraw` function, along with the `previewWithdraw` and `maxWithdraw` functions
    have been removed because the only way to implement them is to support enumeration
    for the ERC-1155 tokens, which is quite heavy in gas costs.
&nbsp;
    @dev Although the only withdrawal functions are `redeem` and `reedeemBatch` the events have been
    kept with the original names `Withdraw` and `WithdrawBatch` for backwards consistency.
 
    @dev This interface is a copy-paste of OpenZeppelin's `IERC4626Upgradeable.sol` with some modifications to
    support the ERC-1155 receipts.
