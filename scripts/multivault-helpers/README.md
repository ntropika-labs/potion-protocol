# Multivault Helpers

This workspace contains a couple of helper scripts used to provide [subgraph-hv](../../apps/subgraph-hv) and [potion-dapp](../../apps/potion-dapp) with the required files to run an Hedging Vault multivault deployment.

## Commands

- `prepare-manifest` and `prepare-manifest-mumbai` generates the required files to deploy `subgraph-hv`
- `prepare-dapp` and `prepare-dapp-mumbai` generates the required files to run the `potion-dapp`

## Supported networks

Currently we have support for the following networks:

- `localhost`
- `mumbai` (polygon testnet)
